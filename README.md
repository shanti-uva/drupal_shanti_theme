Drupal Shanti Theme
===================

A Drupal theme that will be invoked by the Shanti Application on a Drupal Site.

The theme needs to be installed and enabled but NOT set to default. Once enabled, the Drupal Shanti Module will be able to use and display its contents using this theme. Most changes to the theme during application use will occur in place as this is a Single Page Application.
